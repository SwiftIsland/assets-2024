# Seal Island

This is a small app that shows you some nice images of Texel and its seals. The client is so happy with this app that they also want to use it on MacOS and thus requested you to add support. 

The client also heard about the new and improved Sidebar and tabbar introduced in iPadOS18 and MacOS, and requested you to change the app to use said API. Moreover, the client believes the push to the details of an image is not as modern and requested to “implement a hero transition” when the user selects an image from the list.

Please go ahead and make the client, and the seals of course, happy by implementing the above changes.

GLHF!
